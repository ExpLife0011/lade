clinject
========

A CLI DLL injector written in Haskell

What it does now:
takes a hardcoded dll and a process and mates them

What it has yet to do:

- CLI interface
- error handling
- call initialize function from dll
- unload dll
- pe header editing (load on startup)
- direct code mapping
- codecave dll mapping /9x support (Harpy?)
- map through SetWindowsHookEx
